-- | Hostile-peer test harness for Yamux (issue #171).
--
-- Runs our session implementation on one side and gives the test raw
-- byte-level control of the other side, so tests can inject arbitrary
-- frames (including ones our own sender never emits) and decode every
-- frame the session writes.
--
-- This replaces the symmetric self-pair harness for adversarial and
-- state-machine tests: with two of our sessions wired together, any
-- frame shape a conformant-but-differently-written peer may send is
-- structurally unreachable.
--
-- The transport is a chunk-based in-memory pipe that can be closed:
-- closing the inject direction makes the session's next read throw an
-- EOF IOError once the buffered bytes run out, exactly like the
-- production readExact-over-socket wiring in Switch.Upgrade.
