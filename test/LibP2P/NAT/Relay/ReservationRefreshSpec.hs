-- | Tests for client-side reservation refresh (issue #268).
--
-- specs/relay/circuit-v2: "the `expire` field contains the expiration
-- time as a UTC UNIX time in seconds. The reservation becomes invalid
-- after this time and it's the responsibility of the client to
-- refresh." and: "the reservation remains valid until its expiration,
-- as long as there is an active connection from the peer to the relay
-- ... if the peer disconnects, the reservation is no longer valid."
--
-- Three behaviours are pinned down: a reservation nearing expiry is
-- refreshed in the background and the relay keeps routing to the
-- client; losing the connection to the relay withdraws the circuit
-- listen address immediately (driven deterministically via
-- 'closeConnection', following 'ReservationLifecycleSpec'); and a relay
-- that refuses a refresh also withdraws the listen address, without
-- affecting anything else.
