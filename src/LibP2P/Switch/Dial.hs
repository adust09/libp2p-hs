-- | Dial logic for the Switch.
--
-- Implements connection reuse, exponential backoff, dial deduplication,
-- and parallel staggered dialing (Happy Eyeballs, RFC 8305).
--
-- Dial flow:
--   1. Check connection pool for existing Open connection
--   2. Check per-peer backoff (reject if recently failed)
--   3. Deduplication: join pending dial if another thread is already dialing
--   4. Select transport per address, staggered parallel dial
--   5. Upgrade first successful raw connection
--   6. Add to pool / record backoff on failure
