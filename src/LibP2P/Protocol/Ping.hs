-- | Ping protocol implementation (specs/ping).
--
-- Protocol ID: /ipfs/ping/1.0.0
--
-- Wire format: 32 bytes random → 32 bytes echo. No framing, no protobuf.
-- The responder runs an echo loop: reads 32 bytes, writes them back,
-- until the initiator closes the stream, then closes its own side.
--
-- The initiator keeps at most one outbound ping stream per peer
-- (ping.md: "The dialing peer MUST NOT keep more than one outbound
-- stream for the ping protocol per peer"). A 'PingSession' holds that
-- single stream and reuses it for successive pings (ping.md: the peer
-- "MAY send further payloads on the same stream"); the stream is closed
-- when the session ends or on the first failed ping. Streams are opened
-- through the Switch ('newStream'), so each session holds exactly one
-- stream reservation, released on close.
--
-- The listener accepts at most two concurrent ping streams per remote
-- peer (ping.md: "The listening peer SHOULD accept at most two streams
-- per peer since cross-stream behavior is non-linear and stream writes
-- occur asynchronously"). 'registerPingHandler' installs a
-- 'PingLimiter' that counts live inbound ping streams per peer and
-- resets the third and subsequent streams without serving them.
