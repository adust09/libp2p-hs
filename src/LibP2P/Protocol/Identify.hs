-- | Identify protocol implementation (specs/identify).
--
-- Protocol ID: /ipfs/id/1.0.0
--
-- After a connection is established, both sides exchange IdentifyInfo
-- messages to learn about each other's capabilities, listen addresses,
-- and agent version. Like all libp2p protobuf streams, the message is
-- varint-length-delimited on the wire: uvarint(len) ++ protobuf. This
-- matches the delimited reader/writer used by go-libp2p (pbio),
-- rust-libp2p, and js-libp2p.
--
-- Also implements Identify Push (/ipfs/id/push/1.0.0) for proactive
-- updates when local state changes.

-- 'mergeIdentify' rather than replacing it, because a push may be a
-- partial update and must not erase fields it omits.
--
-- A signed peer record that is not strictly newer than the one already
-- retained for this peer is refused (see 'consumeCertifiedRecord'). Its
-- addresses have already been applied to 'idListenAddrs' by
-- 'validateSignedPeerRecord', so a refused record has to have that
-- undone: both the address list and the envelope are cleared from the
-- update, which leaves 'mergeIdentify' holding on to the certified
-- addresses and envelope already known. A replay therefore changes
-- nothing, which is the point of the rule.
--
-- The envelope is opened out here rather than inside the transaction so
-- an STM retry cannot make us re-verify a signature.

-- unsigned listenAddrs (go-libp2p's certified addr book takes signed
-- addresses over unsigned ones). A record that fails verification is
-- dropped, keeping the unsigned listenAddrs as the fallback for peers
-- whose record we cannot trust.
--
-- Verification alone does not make a record current: a correctly signed
-- older record can be replayed. The sequence-number check that decides
-- whether it may replace what is already retained needs the peer store,
-- so it lives in 'storeIdentify'.
