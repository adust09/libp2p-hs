-- | Circuit Relay v2 client transport (specs/relay/circuit-v2).
--
-- Turns a @p2p-circuit@ multiaddr into a first-class 'Transport' so that
-- relayed peers become ordinary 'Connection's in the Switch's pool.
--
-- The spec states that once the @hop@ CONNECT (dialer side) or @stop@
-- CONNECT (target side) exchange succeeds, "the original stream becomes
-- the relayed connection", which clients then upgrade "with a security
-- protocol and a multiplexer, just like they would e.g. upgrade a TCP
-- connection". This module produces the 'RawConnection' for that stream;
-- the existing upgrade pipeline in "LibP2P.Switch.Upgrade" does the rest.
--
-- Outbound: dial the relay, negotiate @hop@, send CONNECT, hand the
-- stream to the Switch as a raw connection.
--
-- Inbound: 'transportListen' reserves on a relay and registers a queue
-- keyed by that relay's peer id. The @stop@ protocol handler calls
-- 'acceptStopStream', which enqueues the relayed stream; the Switch's
-- accept loop then drives it through the normal inbound path (gating,
-- upgrade, resource limits, pool, notifiers, teardown).
